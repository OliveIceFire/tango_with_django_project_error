There may be something wrong when I upload the files from chapter 1 to chapter 7.
I found this problem when I rollbacked my code but found it only has empty files.
My local folder almost became empty because this order "git log" and "git checkout ..."
Luckily with PyCharm's local memory feature, I was able to recover files.
I can only set up a new file to write and upload these files before chapter 8 again.
And I will use the origin folder to upload the rest code after chapter 8.
Nothing will be changed but more commit times.
